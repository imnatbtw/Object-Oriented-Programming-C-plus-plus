 * This lab will show how to manipulate private variables by using mutator functions. These will be accessed through 
 * accessor functions. 
 * 
 * The most challenging part of this lab was uploading to github. I fixed this problem by redownloading the files
 * and doing the process again.

 * Person.h -> contains the interface, declarations of the class, and  includes 
 * the private variables and member functions

/**
 *  Following the examples below, create your own class objects that calls ALL

 *  Use the mutator functions to modify the private variables of your Person.
 *  Display the variables associated with your Person using the accessor functions
