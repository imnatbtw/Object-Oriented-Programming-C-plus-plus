 *
 * This lab will show how to organize data by using arrays and vectors. It will display 
 * the way both contain, access, and update elements and how to pass them into functions.
 * These data structures allocate memory and their relation to pointers which will also be shown in this lab.
 *
 * The most challenging aspect was having many different file and understanding what each one does.
 * After reviewing, I was able to understand why many files are necessary and what they individually mean.
